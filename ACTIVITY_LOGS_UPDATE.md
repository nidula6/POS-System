# Activity Logs & Role Switcher Security Update

## Overview
This update makes the Activity Logs feature fully functional by implementing activity tracking throughout the application, and adds password protection to the role switcher for enhanced security.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Activity Logging

#### Auth Routes (`backend/routes/auth.js`)
- ‚úÖ Added import for `createActivityLog` helper function
- ‚úÖ **Login Tracking**: Logs every successful login with user details and role
- ‚úÖ **Logout Endpoint**: Created new POST `/api/auth/logout` endpoint that logs logout activity
- ‚úÖ **User Creation**: Logs when admin creates new users
- ‚úÖ **User Update**: Logs when users are modified

**Activities Logged:**
- `login` - User authentication
- `logout` - User sign out
- `create_user` - New user creation
- `update_user` - User profile modifications

#### Product Routes (`backend/routes/products.js`)
- ‚úÖ Added import for `createActivityLog` helper function
- ‚úÖ **Product Creation**: Logs new product additions with SKU and initial stock
- ‚úÖ **Product Updates**: Logs product modifications with update details
- ‚úÖ **Product Deletion**: Logs product removal (soft delete)
- ‚úÖ **Inventory Adjustments**: Logs stock quantity changes with before/after values

**Activities Logged:**
- `create_product` - New product added
- `update_product` - Product modified
- `delete_product` - Product removed
- `adjust_inventory` - Stock quantity changed

#### Sales Routes (`backend/routes/sales.js`)
- ‚úÖ Added import for `createActivityLog` helper function
- ‚úÖ **Sale Creation**: Logs every sale with total amount, item count, and payment method

**Activities Logged:**
- `create_sale` - New sale completed

### 2. Frontend Security Enhancement

#### Password Confirmation Modal (`frontend/src/components/PasswordConfirmModal.jsx`)
- ‚úÖ **New Component**: Beautiful modal dialog using Headless UI
- ‚úÖ **Features**:
  - Password input with validation
  - Loading state during confirmation
  - Error handling and display
  - Accessible keyboard navigation
  - Smooth animations
  - Lock icon visual indicator

#### Updated Role Switcher (`frontend/src/components/RoleSwitcher.jsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Password Protection**: Now requires password confirmation before switching roles
- ‚úÖ **Features**:
  - Shows modal when user attempts to switch
  - Validates password before allowing switch
  - Toast notifications for success/error
  - Prevents unauthorized role switching

#### Updated Auth Context (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Logout API Call**: Now calls backend logout endpoint to log the activity
- ‚úÖ Gracefully handles errors while still clearing local session

## How It Works

### Activity Logging Flow
1. User performs an action (login, create product, make sale, etc.)
2. Backend route handler calls `createActivityLog()` after successful operation
3. Activity log is saved to MongoDB with:
   - User ID (who performed the action)
   - Action type (login, create_product, create_sale, etc.)
   - Description (human-readable summary)
   - Resource type and ID (what was affected)
   - Metadata (additional context)
   - Timestamp (when it occurred)
4. Activities appear in the Activity Logs page with:
   - Color-coded badges (green for login, blue for create, yellow for update, red for delete)
   - User information
   - Action emojis
   - Detailed descriptions
   - Timestamps

### Password Protection Flow
1. User clicks "Switch Role" button
2. Dropdown shows available roles
3. User selects a role
4. Password confirmation modal appears
5. User enters password
6. System validates password
7. If correct:
   - Logs logout for current user
   - Logs login for new user
   - Switches role and navigates to appropriate dashboard
   - Shows success toast
8. If incorrect:
   - Shows error message
   - Keeps modal open for retry

## Activity Types Tracked

|--------|-------------|---------|
| üîê login | User logged in | "John Doe (@admin) logged in as admin" |
| üö™ logout | User logged out | "John Doe (@admin) logged out" |
| üì¶ create_product | New product added | "Created product: Laptop (SKU: LAP001)" |
| ‚úèÔ∏è update_product | Product modified | "Updated product: Laptop (SKU: LAP001)" |
| üóëÔ∏è delete_product | Product removed | "Deleted product: Laptop (SKU: LAP001)" |
| üìä adjust_inventory | Stock adjusted | "Adjusted stock for Laptop: +10 (50 ‚Üí 60)" |
| üí∞ create_sale | Sale completed | "Created sale #abc123 - Total: $599.99 (3 items)" |
| üë§ create_user | User created | "Created new cashier user: Jane Smith (@jane)" |
